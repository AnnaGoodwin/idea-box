# IdeaBox Redux

## Introduction

IdeaBox Redux is our second partner project assigned in Module 1 at Turing. Our team was given a comp. with specific designs,
desktop and mobile, and functionality to recreate. Our team used HTML, CSS, and two JavaScript files. One file for our 'Ideas'
class the other file to handle all our functionality.

## Overview

IdeaBox Redux lets users create ideas via a form by entering their idea name and their idea details. It will allow users to save that idea which will
persist on page load (saved to localStorage) plus allow them to edit their idea title and its details. User’s can also favorite their ideas, upvote/downvote its quality (Swill, Plausible, Genius), and filter them based on those properties.  When a user makes more than 10 cards our web app will automatically hide those ideas but can be displayed/hidden with a ‘show more’/‘show less’ button. The search bar in the form will allow users to search through all of their ideas, search based on favorite, or based on quality. Anytime a user would like to delete one of their ideas they may click on the ‘X’ to remove it.
